Still, the overall sound is not bad at all. It's quite good actually. The reason I am giving it three stars are the following:
1. headphones are a little on the heavy side,
2. the arch is slightly hard and uncomfortable on the top of the head, and
3. both the usb charging and auxiliary cables are too short for my liking. The USB charging is less than 2 feet and the auxiliary cable is about 4 feet long.
Others have said that it is uncomfortable on the ears. I have not used it for long periods of time, but I can see how the factors 1 and 2 can make it an uncomfortable experience to wear it for an hour or longer."

These headphones are testing my patience. Let me start with the good then I'll talk about the bad.
Pros: They're pretty comfortable, they weren't that expensive, they look nice and feel sturdy.
Cons: They stop pairing with my bluetooth transmitters. I have 2 different brands of transmitters and for some reason these headphones will pair with one, work for a few hours then boom, it won't pair again. I've tried making sure both headphones and transmitters were fully charged but it's a no-go. The headphones like one-night stands with my transmitters. It will work once or twice then never again. I can't tell you how many times I've tried pairing these with the two transmitters I have and it just doesn't work. Then eventually, I can't even get the headphones to pair at all! It goes from Power On to Power Off.
Completely useless if I can't use the wireless option of these headphones. I'm very disappointed.
Update: The company sent me a replacement and it's been working great! I'm able to pair it with no issues. The first pair has again began pairing with my computer's blue tooth but still won't pair with my bluetooth transmitters but that's okay since the new pair works fine."

Anyway, these headphones are comfortable to wear, the sound quality is good enough and the battery lasts me at least a week at work. Build quality is good and I saved a lot of money vs buying some mass produced beats headphones.

But this product deserves 5 or more stars.  Why I am so excited?
- I've tried a couple of other similar Bluetooth headphones - not comfortable - and I sent them back to Amazon (like Tkqa).  Tried my son's Beat headphones as a benchmark (selling for $100+) for judging others.
- These headphones beats the Beats, hands down, and these are just 1/5 the price.
- More importantly: they are really, really comfortable.  Now, I think this is a personal preference, and depends on your own anatomy (my ear is not your ear!).  I think that this is the most important in getting earbuds, so make sure they fit YOUR ear!  But of all the earbuds I tried, these are the best: they stay in my ear when exercising/running and do not give me any discomfort.  But, your ear may be different from mine ...
- The bass on these headphones is really good. I am an audiophile, and I think the most of the spectrum frequency sounds OK, for little earbuds like these.
- The controls are also good, although I think that the Power On/Power off (also used to answer calls, etc.) is a bit too big.  That is, if I want to reposition the earbuds, I may end up inadvertently switch them off by touching the Power Off button.
- Overall, I think anyone should try these earbuds.  They are a great value for the money and sound the best from all the ones I heard.  If you don't like them, send them back!  (like I did for the many other ones it tried - but this is a winner!)"
391,Terry C.,4,"Good charger, Bad brick",https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH4Z6AB5H3S4O6XNBYHUYC3LFGJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,"I've owned this charger for about 20 days and it seems to work well. It came with a QC 3.0 charging brick that was questionable. On first use, it worked OK. After moving it a couple of times, I noticed that it sparked at the wall outlet when I wiggled or moved the brick (to the point that I was concerned if it was going to be a possible fire hazard). The brick died at about 15 days. I've used a 2.0 charger instead and that seems to work OK, although I doubt it charges as fast as the 3.0. I charge the phone overnight, so it doesn't really matter. I contacted the re-seller. He had no spare power bricks to cross ship so he just refunded me the difference in price between this and the charger that comes without the brick."

It's very light weight and easy enough to get it going.  Then I turned on the projection.  Not what I expected.  The numbers are small.  Ok - I wear glasses so how am I supposed to see it.  I also thought that you should be able to guide the projection so it's above you.  Well you can't do that unless you have the clock by the headboard.  And then I turned on the radio, then the disappointment set in.  This product should not be sold at the price it's set.  Cheaply made.  Oh let's not forget the antennae that is in the description - that's basically useless too.  The sound comes out as though it's in a tunnel.  Yes, I'm returning this item.  So disappointed."

403,MargaretNC,5,Don't take your ears for granted.  Protect them with these muffs before you have hearing loss.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGKSZLFVFZHJRKCJRDUPXOYL7KZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,"I was shocked and worried when the telephone-based National Hearing Test (free though AARP) revealed my hearing in both ears was slightly below expected for my age.  Although my lawn mower and leaf blower might contribute, the most likely culprit is noisy equipment (air purifier, dehumidifier, security camera NVR) that runs almost 24/7 in the house I purchased two years ago.  The Mpow Ear Muffs are significantly more effective and more comfortable than two brands of ear plugs I've tried, without ear canal irritation or infection risk.  The only downside is that the muffs are so tight for my large head that extended use causes my mild TMJ to ache.
Get your hearing tested and protect your ears with ear muffs, ear plugs and esp. by avoidance of prolonged loud noise exposure.  I should have been more careful starting decades ago, but it's never too late to improve."

One of the better mobile phone holders I have seen. It is not flimsy and the arm is able to bend making it easy to mount and turn to the best angle. You don't have to have your screen to full brightness. It stays stuck when driving on bumpy roads. I do not use the armrest it brings because of the glue,  just incase it is difficult to remove. It minimally shakes only on bumpy roads. The quick release button so far so good, it works well. Since it is plastic. I suggest following the manufacturer's recommendation of not leaving the phone holder to direct sunlight when not in use.

For the price they can't be beat. They link up with your device seamlessly and a voice in your ear makes sure you know what's going on between the phones and your device. The tone is perfect with just enough bass and treble. Well worth the money.
