Performs the basic function of allowing me to play music from my phone over my car's stero via bluetooth... but it creates a crackling, kind of static sound if not perfectly seated in the jack. I have to wiggle it around in the aux jack to make sure it's playing both left and right stereo. Unfortunately my new phone does not have an aux jack, and I live in an area with spotty radio station coverage. This is the only way to play my music & Spotify, etc over my car stereo. *I have not compared this bluetooth receiver to other brands to see if the problem lies in the product or my aux jack.* Will update my review if I find the same problem with similar products from another brand."

19,mstaphd,4,Volume Control Makes A Difference...ask Nigel Tufnel,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG3ITPH5HRI7TK7P6LQWM7P2RYFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,"I purchased this version after my Y-Bot, (an older top heavy version of Mpow Bluetooth FM Transmitter) finally fell and broke for the last time.
Newer versions of this Bluetooth FM Transmitter come without the volume control which is WHY I went with THIS version.
The volume control feature makes a difference in my opinion.
I use this to randomly stream music from both my Amazon Music and Googly Play collections from my phone to my car stereo. The sound quality often varies from track to track, so turning the volume up on the Mpow in conjunction with the volume of the stereo gives an added boost.
The speaker phone option works well, but it's one that I seldom use. I just don't see the need in broadcasting sensitive lab results and other personal drama out into traffic. The overall sound quality of the transmitter is quite good, in fact great even...
...however... since I owned an older version of this transmitter, it's only natural to compare the two.
The volume on this version of transmitter only goes up to 16, whereas the older version went up to 32, which is a seriously noticeable difference, really.
That's the reason why I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars. (On  the Tufnel scale the older version went to ""11"")"
20,Vince_A,5,Very good purchase,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEHBGBNABZWQRYXG7PMEZI5OFUUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,"Given the price that I paid for this gaming mouse, this was an outstanding deal. Aside from the price the mouse handles very well. Adjusting the DPI is a matter of a click up or down depending on my preference. The mouse is also programmable and a small CD in included in the packaging. Also there is a bit of RGB flavoring the mouse but to date I left the those settings at factory defaults."

They are very easy to work with and very reasonable on helping if there is a problem with your order or unit. The unit itself is easy to use and I believe to be an accurate reading on the internal temp of cooking meat. I use it with my electric smoker with the extra long lead running through the top vent.  Use this handy setup instead of opening your cooker door to take manual temp readings and thus loosing excess heat and smoke.
The only thing to take note of is this: The food safety agency of the federal government has decided that meat can be cooked to a lower temperature than previously believed and still be safely consumed. Verify and decide this yourself. However the default temps THAT CAN BE MANUALLY ADJUSTED still fall to the formerly recommended higher temps. So regardless you won't go wrong and be unsafe to cook meat hotter than now recommended.
Would buy again. Particularly for the price of this unit. Thanks StarTOP."

Don't buy Samsung's official charger here, either -- I suggest you go directly to their web page, as this site is full of counterfeit devices.

This charger took up to three and a half (!) hours to charge my galaxy s8 edge from 0 to 100% -- a far cry from the ""fast charging"" advertised. And three months after the purchase date, the charging discontinues randomly for no reason whatsoever. I have to continuously plug in and re-angle the charging cord in order to resume charging. On several occasions, I have woken up in the morning for work, only to realize that the phone has charged only 10% since the night before.

Last's well over 6 hours if you leave it on continuous mode. It's relatively quite. Unless you add too much water past the line. It'll then gargle a bit as it has to work a little harder to diffuse it. Looks nice with good craftsmanship. The different lights and the transitional effect gives it a nice touch.

Update: StarTOP responded to my problem by sending me an upgraded Seneo charger.

The filter being washable is a plus.  When it became dirty with lint etc. I just used the lint brush from my sewing machine and it cleaned out fine.  Don't try to unscrew the filter, grab the bar and pull and it comes right out.  I would buy it again.  Shipping was extremely fast.  It works very well without the hose also.
